The term \"Power Five (P5)\" is used to denote a group of five conferences which have historically been the strongest in terms of team performance and recruiting.  These conferences are the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), the Southeastern Conference (SEC), the Big Ten (B1G), the Big Twelve (XII), and the Pacific Twelve (PAC-12).  Teams which are members of these conferences are known as \"Power Five\" (or P5) teams.  Usually this designation comes with a certain level prestige, as the level of competition played over the course of the season is typically considered more challenging than for other non-P5 teams.</p>\n<p>Conversely, non-Power Five teams are colloquially known as \"Group of Five\" (G5) teams.  They are teams belonging to one of the Group of Five of conferences: the American Conference, Conference USA, the Mid-American Conference (MAC), the Mountain West Conference, and the Sun Belt Conference.  Popularly, these schools have a reputation for having easier playing schedules (whether justified or not).</p>\n<p>There are a few exceptions which don't fall neatly into the P5/G5 divide, however.  Teams such as BYU and Notre Dame have resisted joining a conference in the past and retain \"Independent\" status, which affords them more flexibility in creating their own schedules and rules.  Due to the historical strength of their football programs, they are typically not referred to as non-P5 teams, even though they do not play in a P5 conference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sources\" aria-label=\"sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sources:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/weeklyscenario100419/which-teams-reach-group-5-college-football-playoff\">Which teams would reach a Group of 5 College Football Playoff?</a></li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"In college football (and college athletics in general), teams are self-organized into conferences which determine the schedule the teamâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"What is the definition of a non-Power Five (non-P5) college football team?","cover":"5.jpg","date":"2021-01-02","category":"Sports","tags":["College Football","Sports"]},"fields":{"slug":"/non-power-five-college-football-team","date":"2021-01-02T06:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/non-power-five-college-football-team","nexttitle":"Can a college football player declare for the NFL draft and still play in their bowl game?","nextslug":"/college-football-player-bowl-game-nfl","prevtitle":"Why are old pictures of atoms in science textbooks wrong?","prevslug":"/old-atom-pictures-science-textbooks-wrong"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
