To explain why, it is first necessary to define what exactly a touchback is.  The NCAA college football rulebook gives the following two conditions for when a touchback should be declared:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ARTICLE 1. It is a touchback when:</p>\n<p>a. The ball becomes dead out of bounds behind a goal line, except from an incomplete forward pass, or becomes dead in the possession of a player on, above or behind his own goal line and the attacking team is responsible for the ball being there (Rules 7-2-4-c) (A.R. 7-2-4-I, A.R. 8-6-1-I-III).</p>\n<p>b. A kick becomes dead by rule behind the defending team’s goal line and the attacking team is responsible for the ball being there (Exception: Rule 8-4-2-b) (A.R. 6-3-4-III). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From article 1a, if an attacking team causes the ball to go into the endzone (on, above, or behind the goal line), and a player gains possession there, it is a touchback.  Say, for example, the attacking team punts the ball into the endzone and a defending player there successfully catches the ball and chooses not to run it out.  That would be a touchback without the ball ever hitting the ground.</p>\n<p>It is certainly possible for a touchback to occur when the ball <em>does</em> hit the ground.  Article 1b covers such a scenario (for example, the attacking team punting the ball, which rolls into the endzone and comes to rest dead there).  But touching the ground is not necessary for a touchback to occur.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sources\" aria-label=\"sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sources:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/FR20.pdf\">College Football Rulebook</a></li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Yes, it is possible for a team to get a touchback even if the ball doesn't touch the ground.
