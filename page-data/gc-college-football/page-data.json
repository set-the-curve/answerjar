The College Football Playoff selection committee has acknowledged this as a 'somewhat subjective' tool used for picking the final four playoff teams.</p>\n<p>ESPN, for its part, has created a ranking system for game control, although the CFP selection committee has not formalized their metric as something they officially use.  ESPN explains that this number is a ranking which reflects the chance that an average Top 25 team would control games from start to end the way this team did, given the schedule.  They clarify further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With play-by-play data for all games, we can go much more in depth and look at each team’s chances of winning on every play of every game based on the score, time remaining and other parts of the game situation. By looking at those chances across all plays, we can calculate a team’s average in-game win probability, a measure of how exactly it went about winning (or losing) throughout games that goes beyond just the 12 or 13 final results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To try to distill this to simpler terms, teams with a high game control statistic would have a high win probability from start-to-finish in their games.  Qualitatively, this can be looked at as the outcome never being \"in doubt\".  Whereas a team with low game control would have a low probability of winning for most of the game.  Think of games where a miraculous last-minute series of touchdowns pushes them over the edge to win.  It could be argued that these types of games do not go as far in proving the true strength of the victorious team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sources\" aria-label=\"sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sources:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/playoffPicture\">ESPN Playoff Picture Ranking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/96761/determining-the-most-deserving-teams\">Determining the 'most deserving' teams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/murky-game-control-becomes-a-tool-for-playoff-committee/\">Murky 'Game Control' becomes a tool for playoff committee</a></li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"The acronym \"GC\" in college football stands for \"Game Control\".
