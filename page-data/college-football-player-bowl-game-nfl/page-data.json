Of particular note is the following section:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be eligible for the draft, players must have been out of high school for at least three years and must have used up their college eligibility before the start of the next college football season. Underclassmen and players who have graduated before using all their college eligibility may request the league’s approval to enter the draft early.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for a player to enter the NFL draft early, they have to receive approval from the league.  The NFL further clarifies the timetable for doing so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Player Personnel staff also review all of the applications submitted by players who want to enter the draft early. <strong>Underclassmen have until seven days following the NCAA National Championship Game to declare their intentions to do so.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even when declaring early, players have seven days after the Championship Bowl Game to do so (the last bowl of the season).  Players may choose to sit out their bowl games for safety reasons, but there is nothing requiring them to do so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sources\" aria-label=\"sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sources:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://operations.nfl.com/the-players/the-nfl-draft/the-rules-of-the-draft/\">NFL Official Rules of the Draft</a></p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"In short, yes, a college football player can declare for the NFL draft and still play in their college team's bowl game.
