Previously, scientists believed that electrons orbited the nucleus of the atom much in the same way that the moon orbits the earth.  In other words, two spheres with definite position, with one moving in circles around the other due to centripetal force (gravity in the planetary case, electromagnetism in the atomic case).</p>\n<p>However, one of the biggest findings of quantum mechanics is that particles exhibit wave-like behavior.  They spread out through space according to their wave function (which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger wave equation), only taking on a definite position in space when they are observed.  From the wave function, it is possible to determine the probability of finding a particle (the electron) in a given location, but without directly observing it and collapsing the wave function it is impossible to say for certain where it is (unlike in the classical model of the atom).</p>\n<p>With this new understanding of nature (and the mathematics that accompanied it), scientists updated their model of the atom to more accurately describe reality.  Electrons exist in orbital shells, which give the probability of finding the electron in given positions.  Additionally, much in the same way that a guitar string can only vibrate at certain frequencies based on its length, an electron-wave can only exist in certain quantized energy states based on the potential energy well created by the nucleus of the atom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sources\" aria-label=\"sources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sources:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chem1_(Lower)/05%3A_Atoms_and_the_Periodic_Table/5.05%3A_The_Quantum_Atom\">The Quantum Atom</a></li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Representations of atoms in older science textbooks are incorrect because they do not take account later developments in quantum mechanics…","frontmatter":{"title":"Why are old pictures of atoms in science textbooks wrong?","cover":"5.jpg","date":"2021-01-03","category":"Science","tags":["Science","Physics"]},"fields":{"slug":"/old-atom-pictures-science-textbooks-wrong","date":"2021-01-03T06:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/old-atom-pictures-science-textbooks-wrong","nexttitle":"What is the definition of a non-Power Five (non-P5) college football team?","nextslug":"/non-power-five-college-football-team","prevtitle":"Can a team get a touchback if the ball does not touch the ground in college football?","prevslug":"/touchback-not-touching-ground-cfb"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
